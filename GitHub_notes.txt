Why do we use GitHub?

Step 1: Create a github account

Step 2: Create repository (think of it as a project folder)
        Decide public or private

Step 3: Create or add files into the created repo

Step 4: After editing the files in the selected repo, commit!!
        Commit can be thought as saving a version.
        It is good to provide detailed description on what changes are made for the version.
